If you need to deactivate inactive accounts on your community, follow these steps: 

1. Navigate to the User Center and select Managed Communities 
2. Go to the `Security` tab and scroll to the section `Deactivate inactive accounts`
3. Enable the toggle `On/Off` and click on `Confirm`

!!! tip 
    You can see inactive accounts in your list of users through the tab `Users`. Their status will be marked as `Deactivated`. To list only deactivated accounts, use the Filter by Status > Deactivated.

### How to re-activate an account?

If you need to reactivate a deactivated account on your community, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the User Center and select Managed Communities
2. Locate the deactivated user's name and click the ellipsis ("...") menu on the right-hand side. You can use the Filter by Status and select “Deactivated” 
3. Choose the "Reactivate" option
