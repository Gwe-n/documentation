# Manage users

## Needed role and permissions

To manage users in a community, you need to have the role `manage_member`. This role contains the following permissions: 

| Permission | Description |
| --- | --- |
| COMMUNITY_ADD_MEMBER | Adds new members to the community |
| COMMUNITY_LIST_MEMBER | Lists all members in a community |
| COMMUNITY_REMOVE_MEMBER | Removes members from a community |

## Detailed page of a user

To access the detailed page of a user:

1. Go to the page `Managed communities` that’s accessible by clicking on your avatar in the upper right of the screen 
2. In the tab `Users`, click on the name of a user

From this page, you can: 

- Add new roles to the user
- See attached permissions to each role attributed
- Access the list of assigned roles
- Delete assigned roles
- Delete user from the community

!!! note
MSSP community
    - A user added on Main MSSP community will have the same role and permissions applied on all sub-communities
    tip:    You may add minimal roles on Main MSSP community and add extended role on sub-community needed
    
    - Role set to a user directly on a sub-community is independent from other communities. 
    Therefore a user can be set with different roles in different communities.

## Create custom roles

As an admin of your community, you can control what kind of actions your guests are allowed to do. Our roles’ system is based on permissions already defined by us and we keep them up to date following our latest features.

For example, some users in your community will only be able to view data but cannot interact with it. Others can change the status of an alert, write a content proposal or simply duplicate a dashboard, without being able to access other parts of the app.

To create custom roles for your guests, you’ll have to:

1. Access your `Managed Communities` by clicking on your avatar on the upper right of the screen
2. Click on the `Roles` tab then on the `+Role` button
3. Provide a `name` and a `description` to your new role
4. Select `permissions` you want to give to your users
5. Save your changes

!!! note
    You can edit or delete roles by clicking on the icons on the right side of the table that lists all the roles.

## Add permissions

Permissions can be different depending on your job position at your company. In this section, you’ll have a look at all our permissions depending on which product you are subscribed to. There are three main categories to all of these permissions: `Admin`, `Manage` or `View`.
