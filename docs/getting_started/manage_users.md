# Manage users

To manage users in a community, you need to have the role `manage_member`. 
It all happens in the page `Managed communities` that’s accessible by clicking on your avatar in the upper right of the screen. 

To access the detailed page of each user, click on the name of the user in the users’ listing. 

From this page, you can: 

- Add new roles to the user
- See attached permissions to each role attributed
- Access the list of assigned roles
- Delete assigned roles
- Delete user from the community
