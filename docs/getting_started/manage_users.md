# Manage users

## Overview

You can manage users from the section Workspace in the Settings. 
To manage users in a workspace, you need to have the Admin role. 

Each user has a name, date of registration, and a role assigned. 
From the listing of users in a workspace, their role, emails, date of registration and authentication method are displayed. 

A search bar helps quickly look for a member, and quick actions like Deactivate or delete a user can be done directly from the table. 

A role has attached permissions allowing a user to access, view pages and use its features.

In the following sections, you will learn how to manage your users.
