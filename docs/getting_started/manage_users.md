# Manage users

You can manage users in your workspace from the Workspace section in the Settings. To manage users, you must have the Admin role.

## User information

Each user profile includes:

- Name
- Date of registration
- Assigned role

In the user listing, you can see:

- Role
- Email
- Date of Registration
- Authentication Method

A search bar allows you to quickly find a member, and quick actions like deactivating or deleting a user can be performed directly from the table.

## Actions 

To access the detailed page of a user: 

1. Go to the Users page in Settings
2. Click on the name of the user

From this page, there are various actions available to you:

- Add new roles: Assign additional roles to the user
- View permissions: See the permissions attached to each assigned role
- Access assigned roles: View the list of roles assigned to the user
- Delete roles: Remove assigned roles from the user
- Deactivate account: Temporarily disable the user's account
- Delete user: Permanently remove the user from the community

Roles have attached permissions that determine a user's access, visibility of pages, and usage of features.
