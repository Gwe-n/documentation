# Restricted roles

!!! Important
    Users with a restricted role have access to a very limited set of features. They can only view `events` and `alerts` associated with selected `intakes`.

## Creating a restricted role

To create a restricted role, follow these steps:

1. Go to Settings > Workspace > Roles
2. Click on the Add New Role button
3. Provide role details:
    - Role name: Enter a name for the new role
    - Description: Write a description between 10 and 1000 characters to explain the purpose and responsibilities associated with this role
4. Click on the `specific intakes` label to display the list of intakes available in the workspace
5. Select the `intakes` authorized for this role
6. Choose the specific permissions you want to assign to this role. These permissions will define what actions users with this role can perform
7. Click Save to create the role. The new role will now appear in the roles listing with a `Restricted intakes` badge.

## Assigning the restricted role to users

Once the restricted role is created, you can assign it to existing users:

1. Navigate to the Workspace users page in the settings menu
2. Select the user you want to assign the role to
3. Attribute the new restricted role to the user and save your changes
