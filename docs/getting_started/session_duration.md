# Session duration

The session duration for a community sets the maximum idle time before users in this community have to log in again.

The default session duration is one month, which is also the maximum session duration. You can select a shorter session duration of up to 15 minutes.

If you are in multiple communities, your session duration will be based on the community with the shortest session duration.
