# Create and edit communities 

## Types of users 

### Single-tenant users
For single-tenant users, a workspace is automatically created upon subscribing to Sekoia. Users can only have one Workspace, which does not contain any communities.

### Multi-tenant users
For multi-tenant users, such as Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs), a primary workspace is created. These users can add multiple communities to manage their various clients or departments.
