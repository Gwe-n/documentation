## Office365 logs

Microsoft Office 365 API logs four categories of logs:

- Audit.AzureActiveDirectory
- Audit.Exchange
- Audit.SharePoint
- Audit.General


## Collect events

According your needs, Sekoia allows to ways for collecting Micosoft Office 365:

- Through the Office 365 Management API (the recommendating way)
- Through an Azure EventHub


### From the Management API

#### Prerequisites

You will need the following prerequisites to create an intake:

- access to the SEKOIA.IO XDR Operations Center 
- be a Microsoft Office 365 Administrator to consent the interconnection

and to generate logs:

- For some advanced logs, an Azure Premium P1 or Azure Premium P2 license may be required.
- Configure the Microsoft Office 365 logging in [SEKOIA.IO XDR](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/intakes/new)

#### Configure

Sekoia has developed an automatical setup for collecting Microsoft Office 365 logs from its dedicated API.
This setup is based on [OAuth2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) as described in this [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow#first-case-access-token-request-with-a-shared-secret).

During the setup, SEKOIA.IO will ask the following permissions against Microsoft to access your tenant:

- `User.Read` and `offline_access`, from the Microsoft Graph API, to read your tenant uuid
- `ActivityFeed.Read`, from the Office365 Management API, to activate feed subscription in order to collect events.

In order to exploit the automatic interconnection method, please follow these steps:

- Log to the Operations Center
- Go to Configure > Intakes, and click on `+ INTAKE`
- Choose Office 365 intake by clicking on `CREATE`
- Enter the Intake name and the related Enity, then click on `Automatically`

- Click on `LOG IN TO OFFICE 365`, then `ADD PERMISSION INTO OFFICE 365`

- Choose your Office account


### Through Azure EventHub

This is the alternative way to collect Office365 events.

#### Prerequisites

This setup guide will show you how to generate, store and forward events produced by Office 365 service to SEKOIA.IO.
Theses changes have to be made from the Azure web portal ([https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)).

#### A. Event Hubs

As a prerequisite you need an `Event Hub` (e.g. company-eventhub) and to choose an existing `resourceGroup` or create a new one (e.g. company-resource-group).
You also need your `Subscription ID` if you don't have a default one.

Navigate to: `Home > Cost Management + Billing > Subscriptions`. From there, copy the relevant `Subscription ID` that will be used in the command line (e.g. uuid)
Then you use Azure PowerShell (within Cloud Shell interface for example): you will create a global `Event Hubs`, then specific `Event Hub` (e.g. o365-event).
```powershell
PS Azure:\> az eventhubs namespace create --name company-eventhub --resource-group company-resource-group --enable-kafka true --subscription uuid

PS Azure:\> az eventhubs eventhub create --resource-group company-resource-group --namespace-name company-eventhub --name o365-event --message-retention 3 --partition-count 4 --subscription uuid
```

Navigate to: `Home > Event Hubs > company-eventhub - Shared access policies`. From there, you can create a policy (e.g. RootManageSharedAccessKey) with the claims `Manage`, `Send` and `Listen`, and note the `Primary Key` that will be used as the `SharedAccessKey`.
Navigate to: `Home > Event Hubs > company-eventhub > o365-event - Shared access policies`. From there, you can create a policy (e.g. sekoiaio-nifi) with the claims `Listen`.
> Once created, click on the policy and save the `Connection string-primary key`, to be sent to SEKOIA.IO.
Navigate to: `Home > Event Hubs > company-eventhub > o365-event - Consumer groups`. From there, you can create a consumer group (e.g. sekoiaio-nifi).

#### B. Office 365

Office 365 has to be added through Azure portal following the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/insights/solution-office-365)

Then you need to activate and configure the Office 365 diagnostic settings.
Navigate to: `Home > Office 365 > Monitoring > Diagnostic settings`:
- Add a new diagnostic setting, and select `Stream to an event hub`and click on configure.
- Select the previously created `Event hubs`, `Event Hub` and `SharedAccessKey`.
- Choose a name for this configuration and click on `Save`.

#### Create the intake

Go to the [intake page](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/intakes), create a new intake from the format `Office365` and choose the manual way.

### Pull events

Go to the [playbook page](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/playbooks) and create a new playbook with the [Consume Eventhub messages](../../../../automate/library/microsoft-azure.md#consume-eventhub-messages). 

Set up the trigger configuration with the EventHub's `Connection string-primary key`, the hub name, the consumer group, the storage's `Connection string-primary key` and the storage's container.

Start the playbook and enjoy your [events](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/events).
