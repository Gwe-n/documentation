## Microsoft Office365 logs

SEKOIA.IO can pull four categories of logs from Microsoft Office 365 Management API:

- Azure Active Directory audit events (`Audit.AzureActiveDirectory`)
- Microsoft Exchange audit events (`Audit.Exchange`)
- Microsoft SharePoint audit events (`Audit.SharePoint`)
- General audit events not included in the other log categories (`Audit.General`)

The [Office 365 Management Activity API Schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-schema) documents the schema leveraged by SEKOIA.IO to monitor the activities on your Organization. 

Per default, the Audit logging is turned on by default for Microsoft 365 and Office 365 enterprise organizations. However, when setting up an organization, you should verify the auditing status. Microsoft provides instructions to verify and configure the auditing status for your organization in the article [Turn auditing on or off](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/turn-audit-log-search-on-or-off).

## Configure

### Prerequisites

The following are prerequisites to onboard Microsoft 365 logs to SEKOIA.IO:

- access to the SEKOIA.IO XDR Operations Center 
- be a Microsoft Office 365 Administrator to consent to the interconnection

and to generate logs:

- For some advanced logs, an Azure Premium P1 or Azure Premium P2 license may be required.
- Configure the Microsoft Office 365 logging in [SEKOIA.IO XDR](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/intakes/new)

### Collect events

SEKOIA.IO provides an automatical setup to collect Microsoft Office 365 logs.
This setup is based on [OAuth2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) as described in this [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow#first-case-access-token-request-with-a-shared-secret).

During the setup, SEKOIA.IO requests the following permissions against Microsoft to pull the logs:

- `User.Read` and `offline_access`, from the Microsoft Graph API, to read your tenant uuid
- `ActivityFeed.Read`, from the Office365 Management API, to activate feed subscription to collect events.

In order to exploit the automatic interconnection method, please follow these steps:

- Login to the Operations Center
- Go to Configure > Intakes, and click on `+ INTAKE`
- Choose Office 365 intake by clicking on `CREATE`
- Enter the Intake name, select the related Entity and trigger the interconnexion by clicking on `Automatically`

- In the displayed modal, click on `LOG IN TO OFFICE 365`, then `ADD PERMISSION INTO OFFICE 365`

- Choose your Office account, review the permissions and grant them to SEKOIA.IO

After the integration is created, it may take up to 12 hours for the Microsoft API to make data available for the first time.


#### Alternative mode

For any reason, you are unable or you don't want to collect Office 365 logs through the management API,
SEKOIA.IO also supports Office 365 log collection through Azure EventHub. Follow [this guide](o365_appendix.md) for more details on this solution.


### Enjoy your events

You can go to the [events page](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/events) to watch your incoming events.
