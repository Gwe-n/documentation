# SEKOIA.IO Endpoint Agent

SEKOIA.IO provides its own agent allowing to collect interresting events with a minimal configuration overhead. This agent sends events directly to SEKOIA.IO.

!!! note
    The SEKOIA.IO agent is currently in beta for Windows and Linux only.

## Installation

### Intake creation and download of the executable

The first step to use the agent is to create a new intake associated to the SEKOIA.IO Agent.
A link to download the latest version of the agent is available in the description of the intake.

### Installation

The Endpoint Detection Agent is easy to install on Windows or Linux systems once you created a dedicated intake key on SEKOIA.IO XDR.

=== "Windows"

    The following commands must be executed **as an administrator**:

    ```shell
    agent.exe -install -intake-key <INTAKE_KEY>
    ```

    To make sure the agent has been successfully installed as a service you can run the following command:

    ```shell
    Get-Service SEKOIAEndpointAgent
    ```

=== "Linux"

    If `auditd` is running on the machine you must disable it before installing the linux agent:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl stop auditd
    sudo systemctl disable auditd
    ```

    Now that `auditd` is disabled you can install the agent:

    ```shell
    chmod +x ./agent
    sudo ./agent -install -intake_key <INTAKE_KEY>
    ```

    To make sure the agent has been successfully installed as a service you can run the following command:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl status SEKOIAEndpointAgent.service
    ```

 Once installed, the agent collects event logs, normalizes them and sends them to SEKOIA.IO. The contacted domain `intake.sekoia.io` uses the ip `145.239.192.38`. The protocol used to send events is HTTPS (443).

### Update

#### Disable automatic update

By default the agent will update itself automatically, if you would like to disable this feature the flag `-disable-auto-update` must be specified during the installation.

#### Manual update

To manually update the agent follow the instructions specific to your OS:

=== "Windows"

    The following command must be executed **as an administrator**:

    ```shell
    $ProgramFiles\EndpointAgent\agent.exe -update
    ```

    Where `$ProgramFiles` refers to the path to the `Program Files` folder, usually `c:\Program Files`.

=== "Linux"

    The following command must be executed:

    ```shell
    sudo /opt/endpoint-agent -update
    ```


### Uninstall

To uninstall the agent follow the instructions specific to your OS.

=== "Windows"

    The following command must be executed **as an administrator**:

    ```shell
    $ProgramFiles\EndpointAgent\agent.exe -uninstall
    ```

    Where `$ProgramFiles` refers to the path to the `Program Files` folder, usually `c:\Program Files`.

=== "Linux"

    The following command must be executed:

    ```shell
    sudo /opt/endpoint-agent -uninstall
    ```

## Events examples

Here's a non-exhaustive list of kind of events the agent is able to detect

=== "Windows"

    * Files creation/deletion/rename
    * Process lifecycle
    * Remote thread execution
    * DNS Resolution
    * TCP connection
    * Powershell commands
    * WMI Activity
    * NTLM
    * Windows Defender events
    * Sysmon events if configured
    * ...

=== "Linux"

    * Root commands executions
    * Files creation/deletion/rename/change
    * Process lifecycle
    * TCP connection
    * Python/Perl commands
    * PIP/APT installs
    * Cron configuration & scheduled jobs
    * Sudoers file changes
    * Passwd operations
    * Suspicious activity (curl, wireshark, â€¦)
    * ...

    


## Proxy Support

If needed, the SEKOIA.IO agent can use a proxy server for its HTTPS requests. If you want to enable this feature, edit
the configuration file at:

=== "Windows"

    ```
    C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\SEKOIA.IO\EndpointAgent\config.yaml
    ```

=== "Linux"

    ```
    /etc/endpoint-agent/config.yaml
    ```

and add the following line:
```
HTTPProxyURL: "<PROXY_URL>"
```

If you want to automate the installation of the agent with this configuration option, make sure that a `config.yaml` file with this line is present in the working directory before launching the install command.

## Optional steps

=== "Windows"

    #### Install Sysmon

    If you want to improve detection and investigation capabilities, you may want to enable Sysmon. When installed, the SEKOIA.IO Agent will automatically collect logs produced by Sysmon if they are not already collected by the agent.

    > Warning: The installation of this tool will generate more logs which will consume more CPU resources. Install it on equipment that are correctly dimensioned, or try it on low risk assets at first.

    Sysmon is a Microsoft tool downloadable from [microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon).
    A common installation instruction and configuration file is available at [SwiftOnSecurity's Github](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config).

    ### Configure Security log auditing

    A proper security log auditing configuration will allow to agent to collect various security related events affecting the host.
    This document can be followed for an optimal configuration: [Configuring Security Log Audit Settings](https://github.com/Yamato-Security/EnableWindowsLogSettings/blob/main/ConfiguringSecurityLogAuditPolicies.md)

## Resources footprint

We monitor the agent metrics and try to keep its footprint as small as possible. 
Right now on average our agent uses less than 3% of CPU and less than 1% of RAM.
