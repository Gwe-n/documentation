## Is SEKOIA.IO Endpoint Agent in Windows version is able to retrieve events link to file accesses such as denied access to file, modification on file, ... ?

SEKOIA.IO Agent track information on file creation / deletion but not for denied / modified access.
However, an event will probably be linked to a process that try to open a file

## Is it possible to add a Windows Event ID to a file that SEKOIA.IO Agent load ?

It is not possible to add an Event ID. 
For each Event ID, we format the event to follow our Taxonomy (ECS norm) so we cannot add them on the fly.
However, we welcome any suggestions of Event IDs to be collected that seems relevant.
