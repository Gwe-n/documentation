## Is SEKOIA.IO Endpoint Agent in Windows version is able to retrieve events link to file accesses such as denied access to file, modification on file, ... ?

SEKOIA.IO Agent track information on file creation / deletion but not for denied / modified access.
However, an event will probably be linked to a process that try to open a file
