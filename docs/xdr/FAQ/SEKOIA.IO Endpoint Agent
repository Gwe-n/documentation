It is not possible to add an Event ID. 
For each Event ID, we format the event to follow our Taxonomy (ECS norm) so we cannot add them on the fly.
However, we welcome any suggestions of Event IDs to be collected that seems relevant.

- sysmonFileCreate
- sysmonDNSEvent
- sysmonFileDelete
- sysmonFileDeleteDetected

We plan to cover all the ANSSI recommendations and SEKOIA rules as much as possible in the next beta.

We most probably will support Sysmon for users who wish to continue to use it.
