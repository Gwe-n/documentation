## How to get the source of a generated asset ?

In the asset timeline, events that triggered an asset detection will be displayed.

**steps:** Go to assets page and click on an asset then click on `See trigger event`.
![Assets_timeline](/assets/operation_center/FAQ/Assets_timeline.png){: style="max-width:80%"}

The detail of the event will be displayed in the events page.

## Can a same asset be generated by 2 different intakes ?

Only `account`, `host` and `network` will be taken into account on asset detection.

However, the information of the intake associated can be found by clicking on an events in the timeline.

!!! note
     For example, a source IP is a field that will be detected as an atom extracted from an event.
     This atom can be attached to one or several assets (seen in the Atoms tab).
     Please consult [this documentation about atom](https://docs.sekoia.io/xdr/features/collect/assets/#what-is-an-atom).

## Is there any impacts on the assets set as "Reviewed" ?

There is no impact. However, it is useful in order to clearly identify and confirm the assets used.

## Is there any mechanism that automatically delete an asset if no events have been triggered after a given period ?

Asset management is crucial and it is important to manually monitor your assets frequently in order to have a clear view of their activities and validity.

## Are there any assets duplicates ?

It is possible to have asset duplicates originated from 2 different sources.

For example: 

1. The first asset identified as **Marcel** will be detected from an email.
2. The second asset **Marcel (Paris)** will be detected from another service account.

Therefore, the same user will be displayed in 2 assets.

## Is it possible to have an asset created manually and also generated automatically ?

It is possible.

Then we will suggest to manage the assets to keep the ones relevant.

## How are assets duplicates managed ?

Assets are being enrich and updated according to detection rule.
