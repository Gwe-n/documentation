## How to debug Rsyslogâ€™s forward configuration to SEKOIA.IO?

If you use Rsyslog to forward your logs to SEKOIA.IO, you will probably have a section like this in your configuration files:

```
template(name="SEKOIAIOUnboundTemplate" type="string" string="<%pri%>1 %timestamp:::date-rfc3339% %hostname% %app-name% %procid% LOG [SEKOIA@53288 intake_key=\"jOK5bMVXz5Iz7gfogQDbCcC7l7S2IrOs5\"] %msg%\n")
if $programname startswith 'unbound' then @@(o)intake.sekoia.io:10514;SEKOIAIOUnboundTemplate

```

If you want to retrieve the raw data that is forwarded to SEKOIA.IO, you can duplicate the last line and make Rsyslog dump logs to a local file:

```
if $programname startswith 'unbound' then /tmp/nginx-output.log;SEKOIAIOUnboundTemplate
```

This way, you will be able to exactly identify what data is sent to SEKOIA.IO.


```
# tail -n 1 /tmp/nginx-output.log
<30>1 2021-01-13T14:52:06.934860+01:00 ote unbound - LOG [SEKOIA@53288 intake_key="jOK5bMVXz5Iz7gfogQDbCcC7l7S2IrOs5"]  [596451:0] info: 127.0.0.1 intake.sekoia.io. A IN
```
