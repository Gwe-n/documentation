3. On the left panel, click on the `Event Streaming`. If the section is not available in our Admin UI, please contact the Netskope Support.

Find more information about the subscription key on the [official google documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete).

**Example of JSON key file**

```JSON
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "PROJECT_ID",
  "private_key_id": "KEY_ID",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nPRIVATE_KEY\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL",
  "client_id": "CLIENT_ID",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
