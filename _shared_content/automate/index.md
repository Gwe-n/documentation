# Playbooks

## Overview

Playbooks provide a **step-by-step approach** to **orchestration**, helping security teams establish standardized **incident response processes** and ensuring the steps are followed in **compliance** with regulatory frameworks. They will also improve your response time on any security alerts.

In Sekoia.io, playbooks play a huge role in automating repetitive tasks to relieve analysts’ daily work, enriching alerts by soliciting external sources, fetching indicators from outside and interconnecting with external systems like ticketing tools for example.

Because they are highly configurable, Sekoia.io’s playbooks supervise and execute response actions to be in line with your business and operational objectives.
