# Actions

## Types of Actions

An `Action` helps you execute specific tasks depending on your needs. There are 5 main types of actions in the playbooks: 

- Interact with the platform: [getters](#getters) and [setters](#setters)
- Extract data: [data collection enrichers](#data-collection)
- Connect and use [third-party applications](#third-party-applications)
- Set up [notifications](#notifications)
- Use [helpers](#Helpers) to build your own actions

The Actions Library lists all available actions in playbooks with their detailed configuration.

## SEKOIA.IO Actions 

### Getters

**Get alerts**: To retrieve detailed alert information such as the urgency, name of the rule, pattern, etcâ€¦ except events.

**Get events**: To retrieve events based on a search. This action is equivalent to a search on the event page and takes into consideration 3 parameters: a query with filters (`source.ip`=xx.xxx.xx), and earliest time/latest time: two dates to determine the date range of the search.

`get events` can be used to retrieve events from an alert. Events associated to an alert contain the key `alert_short_ids` with the value of the ID of the alert.

### Setters

- Edit alert
- Comment alert
- Update alert status

#### How to update an alert status

To update an alert status, you need to copy the `action_uuid` corresponding to the needed action.

| Action | Description | action_uuid |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Acknowledge | Acknowledge the alert | `937bdabf-6a08-434b-b6d3-d7447e4e452a` |
| Validate | Validate alert | `c39a0a95-aa2c-4d0d-8d2e-d3decf426eea` |
| Reject | Reject alert | `ade85d7b-7507-4026-bfc6-cc006d10ddac` |
| Close | Close alert | `1390be4e-ced8-4dd6-9bed-573471b235ab` |

## Notifications

To get notified, you can rely on these tools: 

- [Mandrill](library/mandrill.md): Send Message
- [Mattermost](library/mattermost.md): Post message / Post SEKOIA.IO alert
- [Pagerduty](library/pagerduty.md): Trigger Alert
- [The Hive](library/the-hive.md): Create an alert in the Hive
